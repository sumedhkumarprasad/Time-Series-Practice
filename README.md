Sales Prediction for an FMCG company

	Project: Predicting the sales for the period of Oct’17 to Dec’18 on two different types of FMCG items, based on the sales data obtained between the period of January 2002 and September 2017.

	Key Findings: For Item A there was an overall increase in trend and seasonality whereas for Item B there was an overall decrease in trend and seasonality. Keep more stock of item A in November and December to meet the excess customer demand during these months. Keep more stock of item B in July, August and September to meet the excess customer demand during these months. After tuning the alpha, beta and gamma parameter for Item A, MAPE was ~7% and Item B MAPE was ~8%.
